Notes taken while working on MPS

Motivation: We want a specific language for the sales domain. The DSL will allow us to model transactions done between a customer and a merchant.
Problem: A specific merchant want to make a specific reciept/sales transaction to its potential customers because the current sasles transaction in a universal one.
Solution: Develope a DSL which will address the problem.

Who are the stakeholders in a sales transaction
	- customer
	- merchant
	- cashier 

In the development of the language there will be two specific stakeholders, the programmer, who will develope the language and the expert in the area of the desired sales transaction.

- DSL is like other programming languages but it is developed for non programmers/domain experts
- Programming language is textual language which is parsed to Abstrast Syntax Tree (AST) when it is compiled, but DSL, we write directly in the AST.

Cash sales: Cash is collected when the business makes the sale and delivers the product and/or service to the customer.
Credit sales: Cash isnâ€™t collected until sometime after the sale is made; the customer is given a period of time before it has to pay the business.
Advance payment sales: The customer pays the business before the sale is consummated, that is, before the business delivers the product and/or service to the customer.
